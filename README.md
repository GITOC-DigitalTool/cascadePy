# cascadePy
A corpus expansion toolkit written in Python.

cascadePy is a Python toolkit developed by [Centre for the Analysis of Social Media (CASM) Technology](https://www.casmtechnology.com/) in collaboration with the [Global Initiative against Transnational Organised Crime (GITOC)](https://globalinitiative.net/).

cascadePy is combines a number of NLP, information-extraction and web-collection methods to provide a set of tools primarily for use in open-source intelligence (OSINT) efforts against the illicit online wildlife trade.

The intended use of cascadePy is to discover, chracterise and expand the vernacular used by those in the trade of illegal wildlife and identify the places they are use on the web.

This work is an expansion on the original work that can be found [here](http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/id/eprint/93062/).

The installation instructions for the toolkit can be found below and a brief summary of each module can be found in the accompanying Wiki.
